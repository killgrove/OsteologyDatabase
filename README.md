OsteologyDatabase
=================

I wrote this Access database in 2007 to help in my osteological data collection for my dissertation.
This is a slightly updated version from 2010, as I've added a screen (and associated tables) for recording major
musculoskeletal markers of stress.  I find that this opens fine in the latest iteration of Access, even 
without re-saving it as a new file type.  But I've included all the versions I could in the zip file for your 
convenience.

Getting Started:
- Download the repository as a .zip file by clicking "Download ZIP" over on the right of this page --->
- Extract all the files.  Pick the format you want (e.g., 2000, 2002-03, 2010) and open it.
- Open the MAIN DATA ENTRY FORM.
- Embiggen. Enter data. Enjoy working with something more user-friendly and powerful than Excel!

There are several look-up tables associated with pathologies, MSMs, etc.  These are primarily based on the
scoring suggestions in Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains (Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994). The
pathologies in particular, though, are not exactly the same coding.  I've simplified them greatly, as pathology
has not been my focus in using this database.  I also never created any reports or added any code to make things
magically calculate (e.g., fusion scores for cranial vault).

For a more thorough but less flexible database that uses Standards, try the freeware program Osteoware from 
the Smithsonian.
