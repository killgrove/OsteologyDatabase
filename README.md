OsteologyDatabase
=================

I wrote this Access database in 2007 to help in my osteological data collection for my dissertation.
This is a slightly updated version, as I've added a screen (and associated tables) for recording major
musculoskeletal markers of stress.  I find that this opens fine in the latest iteration of Access, even 
without re-saving it as a new file type.

Getting Started:
- Open the MAIN DATA ENTRY FORM.  Embiggen.  Enter data.

There are several look-up tables associated with pathologies, MSMs, etc.  These are primarily based on the
scoring suggestions in Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains (Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994). The
pathologies in particular, though, are not exactly the same coding.  I've simplified them greatly, as pathology
has not been my focus in using this database.  For a more thorough but less flexible database that uses Standards,
download Osteoware from the Smithsonian.
